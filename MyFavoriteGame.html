            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>You play as a test subject who wakes up one day in <b>Aperture Science</b>, a morally questionable laboratory. There are no scientists around and an AI greets you. Her name is <i>GLaDOS</i>. She makes you complete tests as if you're a lab rat. Eventually, you gain access to a <strong>Portal Gun</strong>, which lets you complete tests much faster and easier. It also makes the puzzles more challenging. Later on, you are promised a <em>cake</em> at the end of the test. When you reach the end, instead of recieving a cake, GLaDOS lowers you into a pit of fire (which you escape using the portal gun). Finally, you travel through the walls of the facility with the portal gun to reach GLaDOS and take her down once and for all.</p>
